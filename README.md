# Carrier Directive
## By Barrie Millar
### A text-mode strategic game inspired by the 1988 game Carrier Command

## Introduction

Carrier Directive is a text-mode strategy designed very loosely on the 1988 futuristic game Carrier Command. This game is based on a large map containing the enemy aircraft carrier and a chain of islands. The capture of islands is critical to the supply and capabilities of both fleets and thus is a central part of the game. The scope of the game is quite significant and thus a lot of development is required. The potential feature list is also quite large, but the goal in the beginning is to create something more simplistic and add features later.

## Running The Game

No official releases of the game have been created yet.

However, to run the game in the current form, the following can be done. 

- If needed, download Git and install it.
- If needed, download the standard Python 3 interpreter and install it.
- Create a new directory and open a command-line terminal in this location. 
- Run the following to download this game repository:-

git clone https://github.com/CyberArchitect777/carrier-directive.git

- The game uses the numpy library and this will need to be imported before playing. This can often be done from the command-line as follows, but different instructions may be needed based on the operating system and interpreter used.

pip install numpy

- From the project directory, run the following to start the game:

python3 carrier_directive.py

## Repository

## Technical

This site was created using the following technologies:

- Python (plus numpy module). An object-oriented approach has been taken to this project

## Credits
