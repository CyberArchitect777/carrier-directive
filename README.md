# Carrier Directive
## By Barrie Millar
### A text-mode strategic game inspired by the 1988 game Carrier Command

## Introduction

Carrier Directive is a text-mode strategy designed very loosely on the 1988 futuristic game Carrier Command. This game is based on a large map containing the enemy aircraft carrier and a chain of islands. The capture of islands is critical to the supply and capabilities of both fleets and thus is a central part of the game. The scope of the game is quite significant and thus a lot of development is required. The potential feature list is also quite large, but the goal in the beginning is to create something more simplistic and add features later.

## Deployment And Repository

No official releases of the game have been created yet.
